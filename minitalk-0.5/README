Welcome to MiniTalk!

This project is my personal attempt to understand Smalltalk.
I started this a long time ago, but only recently found the
time to port the software to UNIX and to get it working (well,
sort of: too much is missing yet, especially all graphics and
windowing classes).

Feel free to experiment with what is already there, but expect
the whole thing to change considerably in the future.

If you have any further questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project :-), don't hesitate to contact the MiniTalk team by email to

        Hellwig.Geisse@mni.fh-giessen.de

or visit the project's homepage at

Enjoy!
