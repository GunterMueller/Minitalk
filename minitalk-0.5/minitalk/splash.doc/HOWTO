Splash File Generation
----------------------

Here is how to generate a splash file
for the MiniTalk graphics display.

1. Create a BMP file, 640 pixels wide,
   480 pixels high, 24 bits per pixel,
   with any graphics tool, e.g. Gimp.
   Store the file as an uncompressed
   BMP image file.

2. Convert the BMP file with the 'sic'
   tool. The resulting file is a bilevel
   run-length encoded image. You can
   specify the foreground/background
   gray-level threshold for the conversion.

Run-length encoding:
The image implicitly starts with the background color.
Then, strictly alternating between foreground and
background, run-length counts are listed. The output
is formatted in a way that permits including it as
the contents of an array of integers.
